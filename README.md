# Shipping Ship Ships

In Book 3, we began using the debugger in Chrome DevTools to set breakpoints, evaluate the values of variables, and step through code one line at a time.

We also learned how to visualize data and relationships with Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs), and to identify resources, fields, primary keys, and foreign keys.

We used Debugger to identify and correct 13 bugs in pre-written code.

We added our first Event Listener to a project, and used the debugger to step through the code to see how it functioned.  With the event listener, when a user clicks on a walker, an alert box pops up showing what city the walker serves, and when the user clicks a pet, an alert box identifies the assigned walker for that pet.

Finally, we refactored the code to create a city list, and replaced the name in the walker list with a foreign key from the city list.  Then we refactored the code in the walker event listener, the city list, and the assignments lists to identify the correct city using the foreign key.

To view this code in Chrome, run the ```SERVE``` command in the terminal and open the URL in Chrome.
